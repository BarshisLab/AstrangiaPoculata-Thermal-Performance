# Info on Figure1

-You will need to download, gunzip, and place the gshhs_f.b.gz file from NOAA in your working directory. The file can be found here:
https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/shorelines/data/gshhs/oldversions/version1.2/

-The Figure1_map.R was used to create both the inset and zoomed in maps included in Figure 1. This .R script was adapted from an original script written by JP Rippe (jpr6mg@gmail.com).

-The GPSCoordinates.csv file included in this folder contains coordinates for the two collection sites (VA and RI; needed in Figure1_map.R).
